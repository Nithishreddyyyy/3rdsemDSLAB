1 Define a structure student with fields name, USN, Age, CGPA. Create an array of
students and display them. Prompt the user for CGPA and display student details greater
than or equal to the CGPA.
2 Write recursive programs
a. Solve the tower of Hanoi problem
b. Generate Fibonacci series.
3 Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program for the following operations on
Stack of Integers (Array Implementation of
Stack with maximum size MAX)
a. Push an Element on to Stack
b. Pop an Element from Stack
c. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome
d. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack
e. Display the status of Stack
f. Exit
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations.
4 Write a program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic
expression to postfix expression. The expression consists of single character operands
and binary operators + - * / and parenthesis. Apply the concept of stack data structure to
solve this problem.
5 Write a program to evaluate a valid postfix expression using stack. Assume that the
postfix expression is read as a single line consisting of non-negative single digit operands
and binary operators. The operators are + - * and /.
6 Process scheduling in an operating system is to be performed given the process id’s.
Write a C program to simulate this scheduling using queue data structure. Program
should have options to add and remove the process id’s in FIFO order. Program should
have options to add, remove and display elements of the queue.
7 Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program for the following operations
on Circular QUEUE of Characters (Array Implementation of Queue with maximum
size MAX)
a. Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE
b. Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE
c. Demonstrate Full and Empty situations on Circular QUEUE
d. Display the status of Circular QUEUE
e. Exit
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above
operations
8 Write a program to illustrate the following operations on singly linked list.
a. Inserting a node at front b. Deleting a node at the rear end
c. search for an element in the list d. Display the contents of list.
9 Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program for the following
operations on Doubly Linked List (DLL)
a. Create a DLL by using end insertion.
b. Display the status of DLL
c. Perform Insertion and Deletion at front of DLL
d. Search for an element in this list.
e. Exit
10 Write a program to illustrate stack data structure using Linked List. Display the
appropriate messages in case of exceptions. Program should have options to add, remove
and display elements of the stack.
11 Write a program to implement Queue Data Structure using Linked List. Display the
appropriate messages in case of exceptions. Program should have options to
add, remove and display elements of the queue.
12 A university department manages student scores ranging from 1 to 100. Implement a
Binary Search Tree (BST) to organize and analyze these scores. Perform the
following tasks:
a. Insert student scores into the BST.
b. Display the scores in ascending order.
c. Identify the highest and lowest scores.
d. Search for a specific score in the BST and display whether it exists or not.
